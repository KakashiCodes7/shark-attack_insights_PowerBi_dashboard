# 🦈 Shark Attack Insights Dashboard - Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Shark Attack Insights Dashboard** is a data visualization project built with **Power BI**, aiming to explore, analyze, and present trends in shark attacks worldwide. It helps users understand where, when, and how shark incidents happen based on historical datasets. This project is ideal for data storytelling, marine safety awareness, and analytical demonstrations.

## 🚀 Features
- 📅 **Year-wise Trends**: Visualize shark attacks over time.
- 🌍 **Geographical Insights**: Heatmaps and maps showing locations of incidents.
- 🧓 **Victim Demographics**: Breakdown of age, gender, and activity during attack.
- 🚣 **Activity Analysis**: Explore what people were doing at the time of the attack (surfing, diving, fishing, etc.).
- 🔍 **Slicers & Filters**: Custom filters for year, location, gender, activity, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **CSV/Excel Dataset** (Shark Attack Data from public sources like GSAF)
